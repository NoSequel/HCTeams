### Features

* Team system with system teams and claims
* Flexible database handler allowing to easily add multiple databse options, currently supporting MongoDB.
* Timer handler allowing for easy timers to be made
* Command API allowing to make commands very easily

### Notes
* This plugin is not finished.
* Everything is hardcoded, so there are no configuration files.
* Most of this has been tested by a single person, so there might be bugs.
